Hello! I'm Erik. I am a musician, professional developer, and educator. My path into software engineering wasn't linear, and on the way I was not only a teacher (bicycle mechanics, English as a Second Language, middle-school social studies, programming mentor) but as an engineer with a fastener (screw) manufacturer and a paralegal in a public benefits legal aid organization. _For me personally_ programming made sense. I find it intellectually and creatively stimulating.

On a deeper level I care passionately about the linked struggles for racial, economic and ecological justice and try to balance my professional life with this.

I do have some other hobbies:

- Rock climbing
- Aikido
- Longboarding (on wheels)
- Cooking & baking
- Music recording

I live in the big city with my partner and cats.
